// Examples

// 1- (Convert from inch to cm) Given variable $lengthInInch convert it to cm and print the following "[Length in Inches] inch is equal to [Length in cm]cm" (1 inch = 2.54 cm)

// 2- (Even or Odd) Given a number in a variable called $num1 check if the number is an even or an odd number, if even print $num1 is an even number, else print $num1 is an odd number

// 3- (Simplified FizzBuzz) Given a number in a variable called $num2 if the number is divisible by 3 print "Fizz", but if the number is divisible by 5 print "Buzz", but if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 print "FizzBuzz"

// 4- (Greeting by gender) Given three variables $firstName, $lastName and $gender, print a greeting message in the following format "Hello ("Mr." if gender is male, "Ms." if gender is female), [First Name] [Last Name]"

// 5- (Calculator) Given three variables $firstNumber, $secondNumber, $operator create a calculator using switch statement, after doing a calcuation output "[First Number] [Operation] [Last Number] = [Result of calculation] (don't forget to handle operations default message)

// 6- (Grades) Given a number in variable called $totalMarks, specify a grade from A to F to the student according to the following total marks more than or equal to 90 grade is A, total marks less than 90 and more than or equal to 80 grade is B, total marks less than 80 and more than or equal to 70 grade is C, total marks less than 70 and more than or equal to 60 grade is D, total marks less than 60 and more than or equal to 50 grade is E, total marks less than 50 grade is F.
